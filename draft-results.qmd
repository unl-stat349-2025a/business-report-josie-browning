# Results 

## Descriptive Statistics 

In my analysis I worked with two datasets from the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics. I first used 2021-2022 data covering work injuries and
illnesses detailed by source and industry @SurveyOccupationalInjuries.
Secondly, I examined workplace recordable injury rates by industry using
2023 data @TABLE1Incidence. I categorized the data into office and
non-office jobs based on the NAICS codes. The category of office jobs
includes the following:

-   Information (NAICS 51-)

-   Finance and Insurance (NAICS 52-)

-   Real Estate (NAICS 53-)

-   Professional Services (NAICS 54-)

-   Management (NAICS 55-)

-   Administrative Support (NAICS 561).

The raw data includes overlap in the observations, as there will be the
broad industry title with a total, and then several rows beneath it with
subsections of the industry. I decided to handle this by using only
observations with an NAICS code broad enough to have exactly 3
characters. This way, I still had some ability to filter out unwanted
industries (which I only used to get the Administrative Support section)
but captured all information I needed for the analysis. I also made the
assumption that a blank observation (indicated by a dash) represented a
zero, not an NA. Entries with actual NA values were removed.

For the first dataset, there were 2936 raw observations, and 258
sections at NAICS code level of 3 digits. After I split the data, there
were 216 non-office industries and 42 office industries.

For the second dataset, it contained 1074 raw observations, and 95
3-digit sections. Of the 95 sections, 80 were non-office and 15 office.

## Primary Findings

### Mean Slips and Falls

The definition of "slips" in this dataset is a trip without a fall,
which I believe is still relevant to the company's concern of
fall-related safety. To reinterate, this dataset only records incidents
that result in days away from work or job restriction, which I am
generalizing to mean the incidents resulted in injury.

In 2023, the mean number of falls in non-office industries was 3447, and
the mean for office industries was 1847. The mean number of slips in
non-office industries was 972, and the mean was 616 for office
industries (Figure 1). Non-office had, on average, about twice the
number of falls and about 57% more slips. This contradicts the previous
claim of office workers being 2 to 2.5 times more likely than non-office
workers to suffer an injury from a fall.

office industries. The mean number of falls/slips can also be
interpreted as the mean number of injuries resulting from a workplace
fall/slip.

**\*\*Note to Dr. VanderPlas**

I was working on another graph to see the different types of injuries
most common in office jobs, which I suspected to be falls. But I wanted
to see if there were other concerns to talk about in the report, which
is how I ended up with this graph:

I would never use this for obvious reasons but I couldn't help but
notice how high some of these are. You wouldn't expect so many office
workers to be getting affected by substance/environmental exposure or
hit with objects. I looked into the monster of an excel sheet to find
out that real estate is more dangerous than it seems.

While looking though, I think some subsections in the NAICS codes I
assumed would all be office are definitely not office jobs, and there
are probably other subsections that are office jobs that I'm missing.
I'm not quite sure how to sort that problem out without manually combing
through and deciding which industries should be considered office or
not. Would this be a job appropriate to give to AI?

### Total Recordable Injury Cases 

Non-office indutries experienced a average rate of 3.14 workplace
injuries, and office industries experienced an average of 0.93 workplace
injuries. On average, non-office jobs reported slightly over twice the
number of total recordable cases compared to office jobs (Figure 3).

recordable injuries in both non-office and office industries in 2023

### Injury Severity (Cases with Days Away from Work)

Non-office jobs also had a greater proportion of injuries resulting in
time away from work. For non-office industries, the average number of
injuries resulting in days away from work was 1.23. For office
industries, the average was 0.35. Similarly to the total number of
cases, the average for non-office industrues was about twice that of the
office industries (Figure 4). This can be used to make inference on the
average severity of the injuries that non-office workers and office
workers are acquiring.
